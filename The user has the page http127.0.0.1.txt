That error is shouting: “You tried to parse something as JSON, but what you handed me was… an object turned into a string that says [object Object].” Here's what's going wrong and how to fix it:

🧠 What's the error?
SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON

This means JSON.parse() received a string like "[object Object]", which isn’t valid JSON syntax.

Likely, a JavaScript object was implicitly converted to a string before being passed to JSON.parse().

📦 Common cause
This usually happens when a plain JavaScript object is passed into JSON.parse() like this:

js
const myObj = { name: "Hudson" };
JSON.parse(myObj); // ❌ Wrong!
But since JSON.parse expects a string in valid JSON format (like '{"name":"Hudson"}'), JS first converts myObj to '[object Object]', which breaks everything.

✅ How to fix it
Make sure you’re only parsing actual JSON strings. If you accidentally passed an object, you probably meant to stringify it instead:

js
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(myObj);   // 👌 Convert object to JSON string
const objAgain = JSON.parse(jsonString);    // 👌 Convert JSON string back to object
🔍 Where it’s happening
According to the stack trace:

The issue originated from content.js, probably in a listener triggered by a storage change (_storageChangeDispatcher).

Check that piece of code—especially any data you’re reading from localStorage, sessionStorage, or messaging APIs like chrome.runtime.sendMessage()—and make sure anything being JSON.parsed is a valid JSON string.
